This is a dashboard to analyse YouTube trending data between Nov 2017 to June 2018 to describe what the average trending video on YouTube India looks like, and does engagement (likes/dislikes) actually have any effect on the likelihood of a video ending up on the trending tab?
The Entertainment category is by far the most common category on the trending page which is not very surprising since most YouTube viewers use it as a source of entertainment. But what is surprising is the list of channels with the most trending videos. The channel with the most videos on the trending tab was VikatanTV, a regional language channel with about 2.6 million subscribing at the time of writing. As opposed to that, T-Series which is the most subscribed YouTube channel with over 214 Million subscribers at the time of writing lags behind at the number 12 spot, not even breaking into the top 10. The 1st individual creator in the list of most number of trending videos is Technical Guruji at number 14. This clearly shows the recent trend of YouTube moving away from individual creators and pushing content from conventional media channels.

One common piece of advice you get as a YouTuber on how to grow your channel is to make content which prompts your viewers to engage with the content. To engage with the content in this context means to like or dislike a video. So, if higher engagement leads to a video reaching a higher number of people, a natural next question would be whether higher engagement also leads to a video making it to the trending tab? The data does not say so. The Entertainment category having the highest number of trending videos in this time period (16712) has a not very impressive average engagement rate of 1.6%. On the other hand, the Science & Technology category which has a phenomenal average engagement rate of 7.8%, has only about 552 videos on trending. So, this graph clearly shows that having a higher engagement rate does not necessarily translate to the trending tab.

So, to answer the original question, what does the average trending video on YouTube look like? The data says that it has a title between 95 and 100 characters and a description between 350-450 characters. Now, of course, this doesn't necessarily mean that intentionally force-fitting your titles and descriptions in these ranges will increase your chances of getting to the trending tab. This might serve as a good guideline on how succinct or descriptive your title and description should be but there are many other more abstract and difficult to analyse factors which can come into play such as the actual topic of the video, the thumbnail, the length of the video, the keywords used, what time of the day it is uploaded, the channel's subscriber count, etc.
